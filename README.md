# React Todo App
This is my first React.js project alongside I used Tailwind CSS for styling this app.

Check out the live demo hosted on Netlify [https://reactjs-todoslist.netlify.app/]

## Instructions
* Make sure you already have **node** or **yarn** installed
* Download or Clone the repository
* run the app with npm start or yarn start

**NOTE: You must install some dependencies and packages like Tailwind CSS for styling.**
